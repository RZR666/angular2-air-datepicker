# 0.2.0 (2017-07-14)

### Bug Fixes

* **UTC**: By default JavaScript converts new dates to the current timezone causing the received date to be different from the selected date. Dates set by the component will be set to UTC from now on, meaning the date you receive from the component will coincide with the selected date;
* **date background on hover**: Background now changes to a light grey on hover as in the vanilla datepicker; as a side note, they could have done this more effectively with CSS only (:hover), instead of adding and removing a class named '-focus-' when hovering over elements... extremely unnecessary; I'm going to change that when I have the time;

### Features

* **options: { enabledDateRanges: [] }**: With the new `enabledDateRanges` option, you can specify which dates are selectable; this acts as both a minDate/maxDate option as well as a selective date enabler/disabler, bringing together multiple features in a simple, versatile option;

## 0.2.2 (2017-08-02)

## 0.1.2 (2017-02-18)

### Feature
